Set the scene-
It is a snowy day on the mountain. You are able to choose to be a skier or snowboarder. 
Your goal? To get through the MOUNTAIN MAZE!! Try not to run into the white snowy mountain.

If you run into white you lose if you make it to the green you win.
Exit the game using the escape key!

Skills used in this project:

• Gillian Foster and Caroline Jones 
- A summary of your program, including a list of Module 4 concepts used
For our open ended, we created a maze using 8-bit graphics and other graphics taught 
Through the module, the snow created in the second screen is from an in class activity.

- List of concepts used:
  • Drawing
  • OpenGL and GLUT
  • Keyboard listener(s)
  • Graphics with C++ classes


- Any known bugs at time of submission
Will win when at a certain point in the green not when the user hits the green. getColor for the maze vector
was not working, so I had to figure out another way without utilizing colors.

- Future work (how you could expand the program with more
The program could be expanded with better functionality with the overlapping of the maze and multiple rectangles, also
An improvement could be setting a timer to see how long it takes the user to finish the maze.
